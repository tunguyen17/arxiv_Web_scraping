       " <summary>  The frequentist method of simulated minimum distance (SMD) is widely used in\n",

       " on a relatively small number of controls whose identities are unknown. The\n",
       " latter condition makes it possible to estimate the treatment effect by\n",

       " <summary>  We provide a comprehensive semi-parametric study of Bayesian partially\n",
       " identified econometric models. While the existing literature on Bayesian\n",
       " partial identification has mostly focused on the structural parameter, our\n",
       " primary focus is on Bayesian credible sets (BCS's) of the unknown identified\n",

       " <summary>  Estimating the long-term effects of treatments is of interest in many fields.\n",
       " A common challenge in estimating such treatment effects is that long-term\n",
       " outcomes are unobserved in the time frame needed to make policy decisions. One\n",
       " approach to overcome this missing data problem is to analyze treatments effects\n",
       " on an intermediate outcome, often called a statistical surrogate, if it\n",
       " satisfies the condition that treatment and outcome are independent conditional\n",
       " on the statistical surrogate. The validity of the surrogacy condition is often\n",
       " controversial. Here we exploit that fact that in modern datasets, researchers\n",
       " often observe a large number, possibly hundreds or thousands, of intermediate\n",
       " outcomes, thought to lie on or close to the causal chain between the treatment\n",
       " and the long-term outcome of interest. Even if none of the individual proxies\n",
       " satisfies the statistical surrogacy criterion by itself, using multiple proxies\n",
       " can be useful in causal inference. We focus primarily on a setting with two\n",
       " samples, an experimental sample containing data about the treatment indicator\n",
       " and the surrogates and an observational sample containing information about the\n",
       " surrogates and the primary outcome. We state assumptions under which the\n",
       " average treatment effect be identified and estimated with a high-dimensional\n",
       " vector of proxies that collectively satisfy the surrogacy assumption, and\n",
       " derive the bias from violations of the surrogacy assumption, and show that even\n",
       " if the primary outcome is also observed in the experimental sample, there is\n",
       " still information to be gained from using surrogates.\n",

       " <title>Machine Learning Tests for Effects on Multiple Outcomes</title>\n",
       " <summary>  A core challenge in the analysis of experimental data is that the impact of\n",
       " some intervention is often not entirely captured by a single, well-defined\n",
       " outcome. Instead there may be a large number of outcome variables that are\n",
       " potentially affected and of interest. In this paper, we propose a data-driven\n",
       " approach rooted in machine learning to the problem of testing effects on such\n",
       " groups of outcome variables. It is based on two simple observations. First, the\n",
       " 'false-positive' problem that a group of outcomes is similar to the concern of\n",
       " 'over-fitting,' which has been the focus of a large literature in statistics\n",
       " and computer science. We can thus leverage sample-splitting methods from the\n",
       " machine-learning playbook that are designed to control over-fitting to ensure\n",
       " that statistical models express generalizable insights about treatment effects.\n",
       " The second simple observation is that the question whether treatment affects a\n",
       " group of variables is equivalent to the question whether treatment is\n",
       " predictable from these variables better than some trivial benchmark (provided\n",
       " treatment is assigned randomly). This formulation allows us to leverage\n",

       " <summary>  In empirical work in economics it is common to report standard errors that\n",

       " <summary>  Boosting is one of the most significant developments in machine learning.\n",
       " This paper studies the rate of convergence of $L_2$Boosting, which is tailored\n",
       " for regression, in a high-dimensional setting. Moreover, we introduce so-called\n",
       " \\textquotedblleft post-Boosting\\textquotedblright. This is a post-selection\n",
       " estimator which applies ordinary least squares to the variables selected in the\n",
       " first stage by $L_2$Boosting. Another variant is \\textquotedblleft Orthogonal\n",
       " Boosting\\textquotedblright\\ where after each step an orthogonal projection is\n",
       " conducted. We show that both post-$L_2$Boosting and the orthogonal boosting\n",
       " achieve the same rate of convergence as LASSO in a sparse, high-dimensional\n",
       " setting. We show that the rate of convergence of the classical $L_2$Boosting\n",
       " depends on the design matrix described by a sparse eigenvalue constant. To show\n",
       " the latter results, we derive new approximation results for the pure greedy\n",
       " algorithm, based on analyzing the revisiting behavior of $L_2$Boosting. We also\n",
       " introduce feasible rules for early stopping, which can be easily implemented\n",
       " and used in applied work. Our results also allow a direct comparison between\n",
       " LASSO and boosting which has been missing from the literature. Finally, we\n",
       " present simulation studies and applications to illustrate the relevance of our\n",
       " theoretical results and to provide insights into the practical aspects of\n",
       " boosting. In these simulation studies, post-$L_2$Boosting clearly outperforms\n",
